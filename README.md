# **World Population Analysis (2024)**

### **Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global population trends in **2024**, with **predictions for 2025**, covering **234 countries and territories**. The study explores demographic indicators such as **population growth, density, migration, fertility rates, median age, and urbanization**. The goal is to provide insights into **global population dynamics, future projections, and regional trends**.

### **Key Objectives**
- **Population Trends:** Examine current population distributions and variations across regions.
- **Growth & Decline:** Identify high-growth and declining populations by country.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Forecast **2025** population trends based on 2024 data.
- **Demographic Insights:** Analyze **migration, fertility rates, urbanization, and median age**.
- **Global Challenges:** Assess the **economic, social, and policy implications** of demographic shifts.

### **Key Findings**
#### **Population & Growth (2024 vs. 2025)**
- **India surpasses China** as the most populous country in **2024 (1.45B)**, projected to **reach 1.46B in 2025**.
- **China's population (1.42B) stabilizes** due to a negative growth rate of **-0.23%**.
- **Top 10 most populous countries:** India, China, USA, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia, Ethiopia.
- **Fastest-growing countries:** **Chad (5.07%), Oman (4.6%), Syria (4.57%)**.
- **Declining populations:** **Saint Martin (-5.04%), Cook Islands (-3.47%), Greece (-1.90%)**.

#### **Migration & Urbanization**
- **Top net migration gains:** **USA (+1.29M), Ukraine (+1.15M), Canada (+0.37M)**.
- **Top migration losses:** **Pakistan (-1.40M), India (-0.63M), Bangladesh (-0.47M)**.
- **Highly urbanized nations:** **Singapore (~100% urban, 8,332 P/Km²), Japan (93% urban, 339 P/Km²)**.
- **Low urbanization & high density:** **Bangladesh (42% urban, 1,333 P/Km²)**.

#### **Fertility & Aging**
- **High fertility = fast growth:** **Niger (5.9), Chad (6.0)** drive 3-5% growth.
- **Aging populations = decline:** **Japan (49 median age, 1.2 fertility), Italy, South Korea**.

### **Methodology**
- **Data Source:** Compiled from **234 countries and territories**.
- **Analysis Techniques:**
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots, histograms).
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Yearly change-based forecasting for **2025**.
  - **Statistical Correlations**: Examining relationships (fertility, migration, population change).
- **Key Variables:** **Population, yearly growth rate, net migration, urbanization, median age, fertility rates, land area**.

### **Tools & Technologies**
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Data Processing:** CSV-based preprocessing & cleaning
- **Visualization:** **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** for graphical insights
